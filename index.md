## Welcome!

Here is an overview of the main sections of the site:

* [Item Bonuses]({{ site.baseurl }}/wiki/itemswith.html) : this page lists all the Diablo 2 items grouped by their magical properties. For example you can see [all the items with Crushing Blow]({{ site.baseurl }}/wiki/itemswith.html#crush), sorting in descending order. This page may be useful if you are planning some builds!

* [Runewizard]({{ site.baseurl }}/runewizard/index.html) : this is a very handy interactive page that lets you select Runes and see the Runewords that can be completed. Mouse over the Runewords in the table to see their properties. The selected runes are saved between visits (in a simple cookie), so you can also use this page to keep track of the Runes you have stored on your Diablo 2 account!

* **Weapons** : those pages lists weapons sorted by base weapon speed, you can then match the weapon speed in the "IAS Breakpoint" table that follows, and see what are the minimum IAS (Increased Attack Speed) required to reach faster attack animations. *Please note the IAS Breakpoint tables were made specifically for the Amazon.* While the base weapon speeds are the same for all characters, the actual attack speeds will vary from class to class.
